                            Forban Protocol

Abstract

   Forban protocol is a simple Peer-to-Peer (p2p) protocol for local
   area network to exchange files.  This memo describes the protocol to
   announce and discover Peer-to-Peer Forban nodes.  As Forban is a Web-
   based protocol, this memo includes the convention to reach discovered
   Forban nodes.

                             Forban Protocol                    May 2010


1.  Introduction

   Forban protocol allows users and machines on the same local area
   network to share and distribute files.  The purpose of the protocol
   is providing a simple method to share files without a complex setup
   on intermittent local area network.

   The Forban protocol is described in two basic operations:

   o  Discovering Forban nodes

   o  Accessing the discovered Forban nodes

   The Forban protocol used to announce the Forban nodes is a simple
   flooding protocol using UDP messages.

   The Forban nodes serve a Web-based protocol relying on the URL syntax
   convention described in this memo.


2.  Applicability Statement

   Forban protocol is intended to function within a local area network
   where the number of network nodes is limited (below a thousand of
   network nodes).

   The protocol is intended to work on intermittent and mobile network
   connectivity using IPv4 or IPv6.


3.  Forban Node Definition

   A Forban node is uniquely defined by an UUID as described in
   [RFC4122] .  The UUID MUST be persistent on the Forban node and
   created at the first startup of the Forban node.  A Forban node MUST
   be autonomous from any other network services beside the access
   medium and the IPv4/IPv6 network used.

   A Forban node SHOULD have a comprehensive name to describe the node.

   A Forban node MAY be connected to more than one network at same time
   using different access medium.

4.1.  Announce Message

   An announce message uses the user datagram protocol (UDP) to flood
   regularly the network.  The message size is limited by the maximum
   supported UDP size in IPv4 of 65535 octets minus UDP and IP header.

   The destination UDP port used by default for Forban is port 12555.

   The announce messages are text-based messages.  The message is
   composed of a single line without CR or CRLF at the end.  The message
   always starts with a beacon named 'forban;' to detect a Forban
   message.  After the beacon, there is a key-value list separated by
   ';'.

   key = 'name' | 'uuid' | 'hmac'
   value = *OCTET
   forbanmessage = 'forban;'*(key';'value';')

   A sample Forban announce message without UDP headers :

forban;name;a sample forban;uuid;d55727ed-5c6a-49a8-9d8d-28b4004aee0c;hmac;9bc2974df7325cd0ecf517c572fe20859aa2c228


5.  Access Process

   Forban web-based service MUST use the same port number allocated by
   the Forban UDP announce message.  As the URL is built based on the
   destination port used in the announce, the TCP web-based services
   MUST share the same port.

5.1.  Base URL

   In Forban, the URL to access a Forban is composed by using the
   announce message.  The URL format is the following constructed with
   the source IP of the Forban announce message and the destination port
   used.

   http://[source]:[port]/

5.2.  Index URL

   The index URL is used to fetch the index of the Forban and MUST be
   present.  The index URL is a composed of the base URL plus a specific
   path :

   http://[baseurl]/s/?g=forban/index

5.3.  Fetch URL

   The fetch URL is used to fetch a specific file from a Forban and MUST
   be present.  The fetch URL is composed of the base URL plus a
   specific path including the filename of the file name in Base64
   ursafe :

   http://[baseurl]/s/?g=base64_urlsafe(<filenamefromindex>)&f=b64e


6.  Notation Conventions

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] .


7.  Terminology

   o  Forban node - is local area network device supporting the Forban
      protocol as described in this memo

   o  Forban index - is the index of files proposed by a Forban node
